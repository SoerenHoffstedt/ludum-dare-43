# Head Spin Builder - Sacrifice Edition!

This repo is the source code for my entry to Ludum Dare 43. You can check the Ludum Dare page out [here](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43/head-spin-builder-sacrifice-edition) and download the game on [itch.io](https://meursault.itch.io/head-spin-builder).

It uses Monogame and builts on top of my own "engine" library. This library is not publicly available at the moment but you can find it as EngineLibrary.zip in this repo.


## How To Play

- Move Camera: WASD, Arrow Keys or clicking middle or right mouse button.
- Camera Zoom: Mouse Wheel, or Q and E.
- Select and Build: Left Mouse Click. Unselect: Right Mouse Click.
- Build resource extraction buildings to automatically harvest wood, stone and food. But the resources are finite!
- Every Head Spinner consumes one food at the end of the day. Don't let them starve!
- Building *Reproduction Caves* will create a new Head Spinner. But they are expensive and take long.
- Build homes to accommodate more Head Spinners.
- Every two days the **Almighty Spinning God** demands sacrifice. And the Head Spinners love it! You select the chosen one. Keep in mind that you will lose a Head Spinner every two days.
- You lose when all your Head Spinners are dead or sacrificed. The goal is to keep going as long as possible.
- Harder Difficulty starts you with less resources.

## Technical Things

The game is built with **Monogame**, to run it you need to download and install the latest [.Net Framework Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework-runtime).
